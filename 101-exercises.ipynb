        "## Get Python To Do The Work For You\n",
        "One of the main jobs of a programming language is to help people solve problems programatically, so we don't have to do so much by hand. For example, it's easy for a person to manually reverse the list `[1, 2, 3]`, but imagine reversing a list of a million things or sorting a list of even a hundred things. When we write programmatic solutions in code, we are providing instructions to the computer to do a task. Computers follow the letter of the code, not the intent, and do exactly what they are told to do. In this way, Python can reverse a list of 3 numbers or 100 numbers or ten million numbers with the same instructions. Repetition is a key idea behind programming languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "This means that your task with these exercises is to determine a sequence of steps that solve the problem and then find the Python code that will run those instructions. If you're sorting or reversing things by hand, you're not doing it right!\n",

        "## How To Discover How To Do Something in Python\n",
        "1. The first step is to make sure you know what the problem is asking.\n",
        "2. The second step is to determine, in English (or your first spoken language), what steps you need to take.\n",
        "3. Use a search engine to look for code examples to identical or similar problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the best ways to discover how to do things in Python is to use a search engine. Go to your favorite search engine and search for \"how to reverse a list in Python\" or \"how to sort a list in Python\". That's how both learners and professionals find answers and examples all the time. Search for what you want and add \"in Python\" and you'll get lots of code examples. Searching for \"How to sum a list of numbers in Python\" is a very effective way to discover exactly how to do that task."
